	<p> <div id="article_section"> <h1> The Achievement and History of the Chicago Bulls</h1>
		The Chicago Bulls joined the NBA for the 1966-67 season. The franchise struggled for the better part of a quarter century, occasionally putting excellent teams on the court, such as the tough units of the mid-1970s that featured Bob Love, Norm Van Lier, Jerry Sloan, and Tom Boerwinkle. More often, however, the Bulls worked hard for mediocre results. That all changed in the mid-1980s with the drafting of Michael Jordan, the dominant player of his era and possibly the greatest player of all time.

Jordan won seven straight scoring titles with a combination of breathtaking slam dunks and a bag of thrilling shot-making tricks. He put up some of the biggest numbers in NBA history and wrote some of the most memorable chapters in the annals of the league. The addition of Scottie Pippen, another Hall of Famer, in 1987 would set the stage for one of sport's great dynasties.

In the early 1990s, the Bulls assembled a strong supporting cast for Jordan and Pippen which won three consecutive NBA titles, becoming only the third franchise in history to string together a trio of crowns. After more than a year of "retirement" to try his hand at professional baseball, Jordan returned to lead the Bulls back to another title in 1996, one more in 1997 and a third in a row in 1998, the Bulls' second three-peat of the decade and their sixth NBA championship trophy.

Ten years later, Chicago beat overwhelming odds to win the NBA Draft Lottery, meaning the Bulls had the top pick in the 2008 NBA Draft. Point guard Derrick Rose was the team's choice, and he has since led the Bulls to the playoffs in each of his professional campaigns, including a trip to the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals. In Rose's third season, he became the youngest player in NBA history to earn MVP honors.

Prior to the inception of the Bulls organization, two pro teams had failed in Chicago. One squad, the Stags, had been a charter member of the 11-team Basketball Association of America, the predecessor of the NBA. The franchise folded after the 1949-50 campaign. The Packers debuted in 1961-62, but after two last-place finishes and a name change to the Zephyrs, the franchise moved to Baltimore and eventually became the Washington Bullets. </div>
